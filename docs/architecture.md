# Architecture

## Offline-first (permanent rule)

**Plain Week is offline-first. This is a permanent architectural principle, not a feature.**

- The client's source of truth is IndexedDB, accessed through Dexie.
- The UI only reads from and writes to the local database (reactively, via `useLiveQuery`). It never awaits the network
  to render or to apply a user action.
- The Laravel backend is authentication plus a sync service. It is never on the critical path of a user interaction.
- Guests (no account) get the full app, stored locally only.
- Authenticated users additionally get a background sync engine that pushes local mutations (outbox) and pulls remote
  changes.

Any change that makes the UI depend on a server round trip to show or change planner data violates this rule and must
not be merged.

## Data model: Task

Same shape on the client and on the wire. Keys are `snake_case` both on the wire and in Dexie.

| Field             | Type                                                                                                                                                   | Notes                                                                                  |

Server-only columns: `user_id` (foreign key) and `version` (unsigned bigint, monotonically increasing, assigned on every
accepted write).

### Recurring tasks

A recurring task is stored as one **series** row plus optional **exception** rows; occurrences are computed on the
client from local data, never fetched. Every row is exactly one of three kinds:

| Kind      | `recurrence` | `series_id` | `occurrence_date` | Notes                                                       |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plain     | `null`       | `null`      | `null`            | A normal task                                               |
| Series    | set          | `null`      | `null`            | `date` is the start (anchor) date and is never `null`       |
| Exception | `null`       | set         | set               | Overrides one occurrence; its own `date` may differ (moved) |

`recurrence` is `{ "type": "daily", "every": 1–365 }` (an integer number of days), `{ "type": "weekly", "weekdays":
[1, 3, 5] }` (ISO weekdays, 1 = Monday … 7 = Sunday, unique, sorted, at least one) or `{ "type": "monthly", "day": 1–31 }`,
each with an optional `"until": "YYYY-MM-DD"` (inclusive end, not before `date`). No other keys are allowed.

Expansion (client, pure function): for a visible date range a series yields a virtual occurrence on every matching date
from its `date` to `until` (if set). Daily matches `date` plus a multiple of `every` days (counted in calendar days, so
"every 21 days" from a Monday is always a Monday); weekly matches the listed ISO weekdays; monthly matches `day`, or the
last day of a shorter month. A virtual occurrence has the id `${series.id}:${YYYY-MM-DD}`, inherits the series' content and
`position`, and is not done. An exception row for `(series_id, occurrence_date)` suppresses that occurrence and is shown
at its own `date` instead, or not at all if it is a tombstone. The series row itself is never rendered, and Someday
never holds series or virtual occurrences. Any change to an occurrence materializes an exception; "this and all future"
edits end the series with `until` = the day before and start a new series anchored on that occurrence (so a new daily
`every` counts from there). The client data layer owns the details (see
[Client data layer](#client-data-layer)).

The server treats the three fields as plain synced columns (same LWW, same push/pull):

- Push validates the `recurrence` shape and the row kinds (`422` otherwise). Tombstones (`deleted_at` set) skip the
  row-kind and `until` checks, so deleting a row is never refused.
- The three keys are optional on push, all together or none, for clients from before v0.0.2. Such a record is applied
  only to a new or plain row (new rows get `null`); for a stored series or exception it is rejected, since those clients
  cannot represent it. Pull always returns the keys, `null` when unset.
- Clients from v0.0.3 and older know only weekly and monthly rules. v0.0.3 drops an unknown rule from its planner, but
  it crashes rendering an exception whose series has one (its rule summary reads `weekdays`). So the server tells
  clients apart by the `X-Sync-Format` header (see [Sync endpoints](#sync-endpoints)). A pull without it (or below `2`)
  gets every daily series row as a tombstone (`deleted_at` set to its `updated_at`, in the response only), so it also
  disappears from those clients when a weekly or monthly series they hold turns daily. A push from such a client to a
  stored daily series is rejected, like the pre-v0.0.2 rule above, so it can never overwrite or delete one. The
  exceptions of a daily series still reach those clients, which show them as one-off tasks.
- `series_id` is not a foreign key: an exception may arrive before its series (any order across batches). It is
  indexed with `user_id`. Pull only ever returns the user's own rows, so a `series_id` pointing at someone else's task
  exposes nothing. Uniqueness of `(series_id, occurrence_date)` is not enforced by the server either: the client keeps
  it, and a duplicate from two offline devices must not get the push stuck.

## Sync endpoints

Web routes with session auth and CSRF, JSON in and out. All require authentication; guests get `401`. In SaaS mode an
account without a paid plan gets `402 Payment Required` ([saas.md](./saas.md)); a self-hosted instance never sends it.

Both take an optional `X-Sync-Format: <int>` header that says what the client understands: none (or `1`) is a client
up to v0.0.3; `2` adds daily rules. A missing or malformed header counts as `1`; a higher one as the newest the server
knows. The client sends `2` (`SYNC_FORMAT` in `lib/sync/transport.ts`); the server's side is
`App\Actions\Sync\SyncFormat`. What changes for an older format is in [Recurring tasks](#recurring-tasks).

Both also take an optional `X-Timezone: <IANA name>` header: the browser's time zone
(`Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`, read on every request by `syncHeaders()` in
`lib/sync/transport.ts`). The `RememberTimezone` middleware stores it in `users.timezone` when it differs from the stored
one and is a name PHP knows (`DateTimeZone::listIdentifiers(DateTimeZone::ALL_WITH_BC)`, so legacy aliases such as
`Asia/Calcutta` pass); anything else is ignored and never fails the request. This is how the server learns the user's
time zone for background work (scheduled notifications, calendar events) without any user action or extra request.
Server code reads it with `User::timezoneOrDefault()`, which falls back to `config('app.timezone')` (UTC) until the
first sync.

### `POST /sync/push`

Request: `{ "tasks": [<Task>, ...] }` with full records, at most 500.

For each record the server upserts, scoped to the current user, using last-write-wins: the record is applied only if
there is no stored row or the incoming `updated_at` is greater than or equal to the stored `updated_at`. A record whose
`id` belongs to another user is rejected (ignored and reported). Every applied write gets a new `version`, greater than
every existing version.

Response `200`: `{ "applied": [ids], "rejected": [ids], "cursor": <max version for this user> }`.
Validation errors return `422` in Laravel's standard shape.

### `GET /sync/pull?cursor=<int, default 0>&limit=<int 1–1000, default 500>`

Response `200`: `{ "tasks": [<Task>, ...], "cursor": <version of the last returned row, or the input cursor>, "has_more": bool }`,
with tasks ordered by `version` ascending. Tombstones (`deleted_at` not null) are included. A `limit` outside 1–1000 is
a `422` (it is not clamped).

## Client sync engine

- Every local mutation writes the record and an outbox entry (keyed by the task id) in the same Dexie transaction.
- The engine runs only when `auth.user` (Inertia shared prop) is present and `navigator.onLine` is true.
- Triggers: app start, after local mutations (debounced about 1 s), the `online` event, window focus, the page becoming
  visible, and every 30 s while it is visible. A failed run is retried on its own with backoff.
- Order of a run: push the outbox in batches → clear sent entries whose record did not change in the meantime → pull from
  the stored cursor until `has_more` is false.
- A pulled record is applied only if `remote.updated_at >= local.updated_at` and its id is not pending in the outbox.
  (Client refinement: a pending change that is strictly older than the remote record is dropped and the remote record
  applied, because the server would refuse it anyway. See [Sync lifecycle](#sync-lifecycle-libsync).)
- The cursor is persisted in the Dexie `meta` table (key `cursor`), with the sync format it was pulled with
  (`cursor_format`). A cursor from another format (or none: v0.0.3 did not store it) is dropped once and the client
  pulls from `0`, because the server sent rows that format could not read as tombstones. Re-applying the rest is harmless (LWW). The `user_id` is stored there too; if a different
  user logs in, the local database is wiped first.
- Guest to account: guest data is already in the outbox, so the first authenticated sync pushes it and guest work is
  kept. Untouched demo tasks are deleted first and never pushed ([Guest onboarding](#guest-onboarding-demo-tasks)).
- Leaving a session wipes the local database completely (privacy on shared devices): on logout, when sync finds the
  session gone, and when a guest page finds data a signed-out user left behind. The device is then a first-time guest's,
  so the demo tasks come back. A guest's own data (no `user_id`) is never wiped on load.
- SaaS mode: the engine does not start for an account without a paid plan (`account.hasAccess` shared prop), and a
  `402` stops it without retrying. Local data and the outbox are kept, and the page goes to the paywall (`/plans`);
  after paying, the next start pushes what was kept.
- The engine exposes a sync status for the UI: `idle` | `syncing` | `offline` | `error`. The account button shows it
  as a dot (see [style.md](./style.md#sync-status-dot)), plus `paused` when a SaaS account has no paid plan.

## Client data layer

Everything lives in `resources/js/lib/db` (local data), `resources/js/lib/sync` (sync engine) and `resources/js/hooks`.
The UI imports the repository functions and the hooks; it never talks to `fetch` or to Dexie tables directly.

### IndexedDB schema (Dexie database `plain-week`, version 2)

| Table    | Primary key | Indexes                                                                                                                   | Content                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tasks`  | `id`        | `date`, `[date+position]`, `someday_column`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `recurrence.type`, `[series_id+occurrence_date]` | `Task` records, tombstones included                                                                                                                                |

| `meta`   | `key`       |                                                                                                                           | `cursor` (last pulled version), `cursor_format`, `user_id` (owner of the local data), `demo_seeded`, `demo_ids` ([Guest onboarding](#guest-onboarding-demo-tasks)) |

IndexedDB leaves a row out of an index when the indexed value is null, so `recurrence.type` lists series rows only and
`[series_id+occurrence_date]` exception rows only. Version 2 added both indexes and an upgrade that sets `recurrence`,
`series_id` and `occurrence_date` to `null` on existing rows.

Helpers that run inside a caller's transaction (`clearAllTables`, `purgeDemoTasks`) return Dexie promises, not native
ones from an `async` function: awaiting a native promise from a nested async helper can resume outside the transaction
zone, and Dexie then commits early (`PrematureCommitError`) before the caller's next operation. In the browser this
made the first sync of a fresh login fail.

Types are in `lib/db/types.ts`: `Task` (exactly the contract shape), `Recurrence`, `TaskColor` and `TASK_COLORS`
(colour ids only; the UI owns the swatches), `SomedayColumn`, `Subtask`. Schema changes need a new `this.version(n)` in
`lib/db/database.ts`; never edit a released version.

### Repository API (`lib/db/tasks.ts`)

All functions are local only and return a promise that resolves once IndexedDB has committed; the UI does not need to
await them (the live hooks re-render on their own). Each mutation reads the current record, computes the new one and
writes it plus its outbox entry in one Dexie read-write transaction, so concurrent mutations of the same task never lose
each other's fields and never resurrect a deleted task. `updated_at` is strictly increasing, so a local change always
beats the version it replaces. After commit the mutation schedules a sync.

| Function                                                                                                         | Notes                                                                                                                             |

| `createTask({ text, date, someday_column?, afterPosition?, beforePosition?, color?, time?, notes?, subtasks? })` | `date: null` requires `someday_column`. Without positions it is appended at the end.                                              |
| `updateTask(id, patch, { scope?, undo? })`                                                                       | Only `text`, `done`, `color`, `time`, `notes`, `subtasks`; `undefined` values are ignored. Changing `done` sets/clears `done_at`. |
| `toggleDone(id, { undo? })`                                                                                      | On an occurrence: always only that one.                                                                                           |

| `restoreTask(id)`                                                                                                | Undo of a single-row `deleteTask`: clears `deleted_at` with a newer `updated_at`, so the restore also wins on other devices.      |
| `updateSubtasks(id, update, { scope?, undo? })`                                                                  | Replaces `subtasks` with `update(current)` in one transaction, so quick successive subtask edits never overwrite each other.      |
| `moveTask(id, { date, someday_column?, beforeId?, afterId? }, { undo? })`                                        | Lands right before `beforeId` and/or right after `afterId`; a neighbour not in the target list is ignored; with none, at the end. |
| `duplicateTask(id, { undo? })`                                                                                   | Copy (content and done state) with new ids for the task and subtasks, right after the original. Always a plain task.              |

| `listTasksIn({ date } \| { date: null, someday_column })`                                                        | Sorted, non-deleted items of one list, occurrences included (useful to compute neighbours).                                       |

Every function that takes an `id` also accepts an occurrence id; mutations on a missing or deleted task throw. Order inside a list is `position` (fractional-indexing key), then `id` as a
tie-break (`compareTaskOrder` in `lib/db/position.ts`).

Days are **displayed** in a different order: tasks with a `time` come first, earliest first, then the rest by position
(`compareDayOrder`, applied by `queryWeekTasks` / `useWeekTasks`). The repository (`listTasksIn`, `createTask`,
`moveTask`) keeps working in position order, so a timed task keeps its position and falls back into it if its time is
cleared. Someday columns are shown in position order.

### Hooks

| Hook                            | Returns                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useWeekTasks(weekStart: Date)` | `Record<'YYYY-MM-DD', PlannerTask[]>` for the 7 days from `weekStart` (every day present), occurrences included, timed first  |
| `useSomedayTasks()`             | `[PlannerTask[], PlannerTask[], PlannerTask[]]`, the three Someday columns, sorted                                            |
| `useTask(id)`                   | The item (`id` may be an occurrence id), `null` if missing/deleted, `undefined` while loading (also right after `id` changes) |
| `useSeries(item)`               | The live series of an occurrence or exception (a series: itself), `null` for a plain task                                     |
| `useSyncStatus()`               | `'idle' \| 'syncing' \| 'offline' \| 'error'` (`idle` for guests)                                                             |

The UI may not read the outbox table itself: `queryPendingChangeCount` counts the local changes the server has not
accepted yet.

The data hooks return `undefined` only during the first local read. Dates are local calendar days
(`toDateKey`/`weekDateKeys` in `lib/db/dates.ts`). The queries behind the hooks are plain async functions in
`lib/db/queries.ts`.

### Recurring tasks (client)

The rows and their invariants (plain, series, exception) are in [Data model](#data-model-task). The client never stores
occurrences: `lib/recurrence/expand.ts` generates them, as pure functions on `'YYYY-MM-DD'` keys with UTC arithmetic
(`lib/recurrence/dates.ts`), so time zones and DST never shift a day.

**View model.** Queries and hooks return `PlannerTask`, a `Task` plus a `kind`:

| `kind`       | What it is                                                                                               | Extra fields                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `task`       | A plain row.                                                                                             |                              |
| `occurrence` | Generated from a series, no row. `id` is `${seriesId}:${YYYY-MM-DD}`; content from the series; not done. | `seriesId`, `occurrenceDate` |
| `exception`  | A row that overrides one occurrence (changed, moved, done). `date` is where it is now.                   | `seriesId`, `occurrenceDate` |
| `series`     | A series row. Never listed by the queries; `useTask(seriesId)` and some mutations return it.             |                              |

`isRecurring(item)` is true for everything but `task`; `getSeries(item)` (and `useSeries`) gives the series.

**Expansion.** `expandSeries(series, exceptions, rangeStart, rangeEnd)` returns the occurrences on every date from
`max(series.date, rangeStart)` to `min(until, rangeEnd)` that matches the rule (daily: a multiple of `every` days after
`series.date`; weekly: ISO weekday in `weekdays`; monthly: day `day`, or the last day of a shorter month), minus the dates an exception row replaces, plus that series'
live exceptions dated in the range. A deleted exception hides its occurrence. `queryRangeItems` combines the rows dated
in the range (plain and exceptions; series rows skipped) with the expansion of every live series that overlaps it
(found through the `recurrence.type` index; their exceptions through `[series_id+occurrence_date]`). Someday holds only
plain tasks and exceptions moved there. An exception whose series is gone (for example, deleted on another device
before this exception synced) still shows, as a plain-looking task.

**Duplicate exceptions.** The server does not keep `(series_id, occurrence_date)` unique, so two offline devices can
each write an exception for the same occurrence. Locally an occurrence id always resolves to its existing exception, so
the repository never writes a second one; duplicates that arrive through sync are settled by `winningException`: the
newest `updated_at` wins, then the greater `id`. Only the winner is shown or resolved (a losing row's own id resolves to
`null`), and a deleted winner hides the occurrence.

**Resolving ids.** `queryTask` / `useTask` accept an occurrence id. Once that occurrence has an exception row, the id
resolves to the row (which has its own id), and to `null` if the exception is deleted, so an id taken from the screen
keeps working after the first change.

**Mutations on an occurrence** (all in one transaction, one outbox entry per written row):

| Change                          | Scope `'this'` (default for edits)                                                                                           | Scope `'future'` (edits, delete, rule)                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `updateTask` / `updateSubtasks` | Writes an exception row (new UUID v7) with the change.                                                                       | Split at the occurrence date D: the series gets `until = D-1`, a new series with the edit starts on D. |
| `toggleDone`, `moveTask`        | Always `'this'`: writes or updates the exception.                                                                            |                                                                                                        |
| `deleteTask`                    | A deleted exception row.                                                                                                     | `until = D-1`; when D is the series' first occurrence, the series and its exceptions are deleted.      |
| `setRecurrence(id, rule)`       | This item starts its own series on D with the new rule; the old series keeps its rule and gets a deleted exception hiding D. | Default. Split at D; the new series has this item's content and the new rule.                          |
| `setRecurrence(id, null)`       | This item becomes a plain task; a deleted exception keeps its date hidden.                                                   | Default. `until = D-1`; this item becomes a plain task (an exception row keeps its id).                |
| `duplicateTask`                 | The copy is a plain task right after the source; the source gets its exception row.                                          |                                                                                                        |

A split also deletes the series' exceptions dated D or later. When D is on or before the series' first occurrence
(`startsSeries`: the anchor, or the first date after it the rule matches) there is nothing to keep, so the series
row itself takes the new content or rule (same id) instead of ending. A rule change with scope `'this'` is a split for
one date only: the occurrence leaves its series and becomes the start of a new, independent series (its content, an
exception's edits included, and the new rule from D on), while the old series goes on with its rule and skips D. Both
series then show on dates they share. `done` never reaches a series: a `'future'` patch applies its other fields; the
new series takes this item's content (an exception's earlier edits included). Scope is ignored for plain tasks.

`setRecurrence` validates the rule and stores it in canonical form (`normalizeRecurrence`: weekdays unique and sorted,
`day` 1–31, `until` not before the anchor) and throws otherwise, so the server never refuses it. The anchor date does
not have to match the rule: the series then starts at the next matching date and the item disappears from the anchor
day, so the UI should preselect the anchor's weekday or day of the month.

On rows: `setRecurrence` on a plain dated task makes it the series (its `date` is the anchor; Someday tasks cannot
repeat). On a series row, `updateTask` edits every occurrence without an exception, `setRecurrence` replaces the rule
(existing exceptions stay; `null` makes it a plain task and deletes its exceptions), `deleteTask` deletes it with its exceptions, and `moveTask`
throws.

**What to show after a change.** The mutations return the item that now stands for what the user acted on: the
exception for a `'this'` edit, the new series' occurrence on D for a `'future'` edit or rule change (the series itself
when its rule skips D), the plain task when repeating stops. The occurrence id the UI held may then resolve to `null`
(its series ended), so a dialog should switch to the returned id. The first change of an occurrence also changes its
`id` (occurrence id to exception row id), which UI keys and drag ids need to tolerate.

Occurrences take the series' `position`, which can tie with a plain task's position in the same day (`compareTaskOrder`
then orders by id). Placing a task between two tied neighbours puts it after both.

**Undo.** `restoreTask(occurrenceId)` restores a deleted occurrence. Changes that touch several rows (`'future'` scope)
are undone with an `UndoLog`: `const undo = createUndoLog(); await deleteTask(id, { scope: 'future', undo });` and later
`undoChanges(undo)`, which writes the previous versions back as newer changes. A row the logged mutations created is
deleted, except an exception: deleting it would hide its occurrence, so it goes back to the series' content instead.

**Sync.** Nothing special: the three fields are columns of the record, pushed and pulled with last-write-wins like the
rest. Every pushed record carries all three keys (`null` when unset; the server refuses partial keys), and `toTask`
defaults them to `null` on pull.

### Sync lifecycle (`lib/sync`)

- `SyncProvider` (`components/sync-provider.tsx`) is mounted once at the planner root. When the Inertia shared prop
  `auth.user` is present it starts the singleton `syncEngine`; when it disappears it stops it. Guests never sync.
- Triggers: start, 1 s after the last local mutation, `online`, window `focus`, `visibilitychange` to visible, and
  every 30 s while the page is visible. Only one run at a time; a trigger during a run queues one more run. Runs hold a
  cross-tab Web Lock (`lib/sync/lock.ts`), so tabs never interleave runs or a logout wipe. The lock is released as soon
  as the run settles, and a run waits at most 60 s for it (another tab's run) before trying again later.
- Nothing waits on the network: every request is aborted after 20 s without an answer (the engine wraps the injected
  transport, so even one that ignores the abort signal cannot hold a run or the lock), and `stop()` aborts the request
  in flight.
- A run:
    1. Claims the database for the user: if `meta.user_id` is a different user, everything is wiped (including that
       user's unsynced changes); if there is no owner, the guest data is kept and pushed. Demo tasks still in
       `meta.demo_ids` are deleted (no tombstones: the server never had them).
    2. Pushes the outbox in batches of 500. After each batch it deletes the entries whose `revision` did not change while
       the request was in flight (applied, rejected and stale records alike). The push response `cursor` is not a pull
       position and is ignored.
    3. Pulls from `meta.cursor` with `limit=500` until `has_more` is false, storing the cursor (from pull responses only)
       after each page.
- Pull applies last-write-wins: a remote record replaces the local one if it is newer, or equally new and not pending in
  the outbox. If a pending local change is older than the remote record, the server would refuse it anyway, so the
  remote record is applied and the pending entry dropped: both sides converge.
- Errors:
    - `401` means the session is gone (expired, logged out elsewhere): the engine wipes the local database under the
      lock, stops, and `onSessionExpired` tells the other tabs and reloads the page as a guest. If changes are still
      pending (edits made offline before the session expired) it asks first, like logout; declining keeps everything
      and only stops the engine, so the changes are pushed when the same user signs in again. A `419` on push (the XSRF token of an ended session) is confirmed first with a `pull` (no token needed):
      a `401` there wipes, a `402` pauses (below); otherwise the session is alive, that pull refreshed the token, and
      the `419` is retried like any transient failure.
    - `422`/`413` are permanent: the batch is split until the invalid records are isolated; each is quarantined
      (`failed_revision` = its revision, logged with `console.warn`) and skipped until the task changes again. The rest
      of the outbox and the pull carry on; the status stays `error` while a record is quarantined.
    - Every other failure is retried on its own: a timer with exponential backoff and "equal" jitter (2 s doubling up
      to 5 min, each delay between half and all of that), never sooner than a `Retry-After` the server sent (`429`,
      `503`; capped at 5 min too). `online`, window focus and the page becoming visible retry at once (but never
      before a `Retry-After`); the failure streak is kept, so the backoff keeps growing while it fails. A success
      resets it. After a timeout the push batch and the pull `limit` are halved (down to 1/64), so a slow uplink still
      gets through; a successful run restores them. Re-pushing after a request that
      timed out is safe: push is idempotent under last-write-wins, and an outbox entry is only cleared by a response.
    - Status while retrying: network failures (`SyncNetworkError`: `fetch` itself failed) and timeouts read as
      `offline`. Other transient failures (`5xx`, `408`, `429`, a `419` with a live session, the lock not granted) read
      as `syncing` until the server has been failing for 2 min (time offline does not count), then `error`. Any other failure (an unexpected `4xx`, a local error) is `error` at once, and still retried.
    - "Retry sync" (account menu, shown on `error`) calls `sync({ force: true })`: it runs at once and resets the
      backoff. Runs are cancelled by `stop()` and never write after it.
- Status: `syncing` during a run, then `idle`, `offline` or `error` (or `syncing` while retrying, see above).
  `useVisibleSyncStatus` debounces it for the UI: a run reads as `syncing` only after 600 ms, and until then the status
  before the run is kept, so a retry while offline never flashes `idle`.
- Logout: the logout links use `useLogout()` → `logOut()`. It forces a sync and waits for it 10 s at most; if changes
  are still pending (offline, errors, a slow connection) it asks before discarding them. Then it ends the server session (`POST /logout`) and only after that wipes
  the local database under the sync lock (every table and meta key, onboarding flags included) and tells other tabs
  (BroadcastChannel `plain-week-session`), which stop their engines and reload into the guest state. If the server
  logout fails, nothing is wiped and syncing resumes.
- Session ended without a logout on this device: on guest pages `SyncProvider` calls `forgetEndedSession()`. If
  `meta.user_id` is set, it asks the server (`GET /sync/pull?limit=1`); only a `401` wipes the database (asking first
  about pending changes), tells other tabs and reloads as a guest. Offline, or when the server still knows the user (a stale offline shell), nothing
  changes. Guest data has no `user_id`, so a guest never triggers it.
- HTTP: `fetchTransport` calls `/sync/push` and `/sync/pull` (Wayfinder helpers `@/routes/sync`) with `credentials: 'same-origin'`, `Accept:
application/json` and the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header from Laravel's `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie.

### Guest onboarding: demo tasks

A guest's very first visit gets a few demo tasks in the current week that teach the planner (complete on hover, click to
edit, drag, color, timed tasks first, right click, a weekly series on Friday, Someday). They live only on this device.

- **Seeding.** `useGuestOnboarding` (planner page, guests only, once the current week is on screen) calls
  `seedDemoTasks` (`lib/db/demo-tasks.ts`). A small transaction claims the onboarding: it sets `meta.demo_seeded` and
  goes on only if the flag was absent, there is no `meta.user_id` and no task at all. The tasks are then created
  through the repository with `{ demo: true }`, so each write puts its rows in `meta.demo_ids` without an outbox entry
  in its own transaction (a seed cut short leaves fewer demo tasks, never something to push). The flag stays
  while the device keeps its data, so the demo never comes back after the guest deletes every demo task. Leaving a
  session (logout, or a session found gone) wipes it with everything else, so the device is a first-time guest again
  and the demo is seeded on the next planner view.
- **Never synced.** A demo row has no outbox entry, so it is never pushed and does not count as pending work (the guest
  "save" button stays off until the guest makes a change).
- **Becoming real.** `write()` in `lib/db/tasks.ts` calls `trackDemoRows` (`lib/db/demo.ts`) in the same transaction.
  Edits, completion, moves, duplicates and repeat changes (`release`) take the rows they write, the id the user acted on
  and their series out of `demo_ids`, together with the whole series family (a series and its exceptions), and queue
  the ones not written in that change. Deletes, restores and undos (`keep`) leave demo rows demo, and add the rows they
  derive from them (for example the deleted exception of a demo occurrence), so deleting a demo task never syncs a
  tombstone.
- **Signing up or in.** `SyncEngine.claimDatabase` runs `purgeDemoTasks` before the first push: the demo rows still in
  `demo_ids` are hard-deleted locally. Edited ones were released, so they are pushed like any guest work. Signed-in
  users never get demo tasks.

### Adding a new synced entity

1. Add its type to `lib/db/types.ts` and a table in a new Dexie `version(n)` in `lib/db/database.ts`.
2. Extend the outbox to identify the entity (for example an `entity` field next to the id) and write the record plus
   the outbox entry in one transaction from a repository module, with `nextTimestamp()` for `updated_at` and
   `notifyLocalChange()` after commit.
3. Extend the contract here and the push/pull payloads (server and `lib/sync/transport.ts`), then group the outbox by
   entity in `SyncEngine.push` and apply the new collection in `SyncEngine.applyRemote` with the same LWW rule.
4. Add the new table to `allTables()` in `lib/db/database.ts` so every wipe and sync transaction includes it.
5. Cover it with Vitest tests (repository + engine against `test/fake-sync-server.ts`).

## Export format

A JSON backup of the local database, for registered users, on the Settings › Data page (`/settings/data`,
[style.md](./style.md#settings--data)). The page is a server-rendered Inertia page, but export and import run entirely on
the client (`lib/transfer`) against IndexedDB, so they work offline once the page is loaded.

The planner's `SyncProvider` is not mounted on settings pages, so the Data page mounts its own, and both actions first
call `prepareLocalData(userId)` (`lib/sync`): it claims the local database for the signed-in user, exactly like a sync
run (`claimDatabaseFor`: another user's data is wiped, guest data kept), so a later run never wipes what the import
wrote (when the database already belongs to that user it skips the lock), then runs one sync (forced, even during
back-off) so an export includes the latest server data, waiting for it 3 s at most. When that sync does not finish in
time (offline, errors, a slow connection) the export still happens, and its toast says changes from other devices may
be missing.
Imported rows are pushed by that page's engine right away, or by the planner's on the next visit. Like any sync run,
the claim wipes another user's leftover local data (which only exists after a session ended without a logout).

```json
{
    "format": "plain-week",
    "version": 1,
    "exported_at": "2026-10-15T08:35:00.123Z",
    "app_version": "0.0.3",
    "tasks": [<Task>, ...]
}
```

- File name: `plain-week-export-YYYY-MM-DD.json` (local date). `app_version` is `package.json`'s version, injected at
  build time (`__APP_VERSION__`); it is informational only.
- `tasks` holds rows with exactly the [Task](#data-model-task) wire shape, `recurrence`, `series_id` and
  `occurrence_date` included. Left out: tombstones, exceptions of a deleted series, and losing duplicate exceptions
  (only the `winningException` of each occurrence is kept). One kind of tombstone is kept on purpose: the deleted
  exception of a live series, because it is what hides a deleted occurrence; without it the occurrence would come back.
  Demo tasks ([Guest onboarding](#guest-onboarding-demo-tasks), `meta.demo_ids`) are never exported: `buildExport`
  skips them, and `prepareLocalData`'s claim already purges the untouched ones, like the first sync of a new account.
- `version` changes only for incompatible changes. A newer version is refused with a message to update Plain Week.

Import **adds** tasks; it never changes or removes existing ones (importing the same file twice gives two copies):

- The file's rows go through the same selection as the export (`backupRows`), so a hand-edited file is cleaned up the
  same way (for example, exceptions of a series deleted in the file are dropped).
- Every row gets a new UUID v7 id, series first, so their ids sort (and sync) before their exceptions; an exception's
  `series_id` points at its series' new id. An exception whose series is not in the file becomes a plain task (a
  deleted one is dropped). Duplicate exceptions in the file are settled with
  `winningException` before the ids change, since the new rows all share one `updated_at`.
- Positions are appended after the existing tasks of each day / Someday column (`generateNKeysBetween` after the
  column's last key), keeping the file's relative order.
- `created_at` and `updated_at` are now (one `nextTimestamp()`); `done`, `done_at` and subtasks (with their ids) are kept;
  kept exception tombstones get `deleted_at` = now.
- The outbox entries make the sync push the new rows like any other local change.

## Planner UI

`resources/js/pages/planner.tsx` composes the components in `resources/js/components/planner/` (layout and
measurements in [style.md](./style.md#planner-layout)). It follows the offline-first rule:

- Data comes only from the live hooks (`useWeekTasks`, `useSomedayTasks`); writes go through
  the repository (`createTask`, `toggleDone`, and in the task dialog `updateTask`, `updateSubtasks`, `moveTask`,
  `duplicateTask`, `deleteTask`, `setRecurrence`, undone with an `UndoLog`) without awaiting them. Write failures show
  a toast.
- The task dialog writes through a per-dialog queue (`task-dialog/task-editor.tsx`): each write runs after the previous
  one, on the id the previous one returned, and the dialog switches to it. That is how it survives an occurrence
  becoming an exception or a "this and all future" split ending the id it opened with. Scoped edits on a recurring task
  ask "Only this task / This and all future" once per dialog (see [style.md](./style.md#recurring-tasks)).
- `SyncProvider` is mounted at the page root.
- The shown week lives in the URL (`?week=YYYY-MM-DD`, the Monday; dropped for the current week), so changing weeks
  needs no server round trip and works offline (`hooks/use-week-navigation.ts`, pure helpers `weekFromUrl` /
  `canonicalWeekUrl` in `lib/planner/week.ts`).
    - On load an invalid or non-Monday value is normalized at once. Inertia records the server URL in history
      asynchronously after the first render, so this one write is an Inertia client visit (`router.replace`, no
      request), which goes through Inertia's history queue and keeps its page URL canonical.
    - Every week change after that uses `history.replaceState` directly (keeping Inertia's history state), never a
      server visit; held arrow keys do not repeat and rate-limit errors are ignored.
- Task links: `/?task=<id>` (a task id or an occurrence id `${seriesId}:${YYYY-MM-DD}`) opens the planner on that
  task's week (Someday: the current week) with its dialog open. Push notifications and calendar events link here;
  for a recurring task they link to the occurrence id (a series id opens the series' first date).
  `useTaskLink` (`hooks/use-task-link.ts`, helpers in `lib/planner/task-link.ts`) reads the parameter once when the
  planner mounts and looks the task up with a live query, so a task that only arrives with the first sync after the
  load still opens. Once a sync run has finished (at once for guests or offline) and at least 10 s have passed, a task
  still missing is given up silently. Nothing waits on it. `?task=` is dropped from the URL (with `history.replaceState`, keeping `?week=`)
  when the dialog closes or the lookup gives up; a link that resolves while another task's dialog is open is ignored.
- Keyboard shortcuts: see [Keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts).
- "Today" comes from `useToday()`, the only place the planner reads the date: a shared store (`lib/planner/today.ts`)
  that, while the planner is open, re-reads the clock on a timeout to local midnight, every 30 s, and on `focus`,
  `pageshow`, `online` and `visibilitychange` (visible), and re-renders only when the date key changes. The timeout
  alone was not enough: timers stall while a laptop sleeps, and a tab that was visible when the lid closed is still
  visible when it opens, so `visibilitychange` never fires and the planner stayed on yesterday until a reload. When the
  date moves into a new week while the current week is shown, `useWeekNavigation` follows to the new current week; a
  week the user navigated to stays.
- Unfinished tasks of earlier days move to today: see [Carry over](#carry-over-unfinished-tasks).
- Pure logic lives in `lib/planner/` with unit tests: ISO week math and the desktop column layout (`week.ts`), smart
  time (`smart-time.ts`), date labels (`format.ts`), task color styles (`task-colors.ts`) and drop resolution
  (`drop.ts`).

### Carry over unfinished tasks

The "Move unfinished tasks to today" preference (Settings › Preferences, on by default) moves yesterday's leftovers
forward, like a paper planner rewritten each morning.

- **When.** `useCarryOver(today)` (called by `PlannerLayout`) runs `carryOverTasks(today)` when the planner opens and
  whenever `useToday()` rolls over, while the setting is on. A signed-in device with a started sync engine first waits
  for one sync run, so a task completed on another device since the last sync is pulled before this device moves it
  (with whole-record last-write-wins the newer move would otherwise undo that). The hook relies on parent effects
  running after their children's: `PlannerLayout` renders `SyncProvider`, so the engine has started by then. Offline
  the run returns at once and the move is a local edit like any other.
- **What moves** (`isCarriedOver` in `lib/db/carry-over.ts`): live tasks that are not done, have a date (Someday never
  falls behind) before today, and are plain tasks. Recurring tasks are never carried: a series row only anchors its
  rule, an occurrence or its exception row belongs to its date, and the series comes back on its next date anyway, so
  carrying would show it twice. Demo tasks the guest never touched stay on the day they teach (they are released, and
  carried, once edited).
- **Where.** At the end of today, after its existing tasks (occurrences included), oldest day first and in each day's
  position order. Subtasks are part of the row, so they travel with it. One
  quiet toast per run says how many moved ("Moved 3 unfinished tasks to today"), never one per task; only the tab whose
  transaction moved them shows it.
- **Safety.** The repository reads and writes in one transaction through the usual `write()` (rows plus outbox entries,
  newer `updated_at`), so it is idempotent and two tabs never move a task twice. Two devices doing it converge through
  LWW: a move keeps the id, so it never duplicates; the later move's position wins.
- **Known limits.** Last-write-wins is per record: if another device marks a task done while offline and this device
  moves it before that change is pushed, the newer move wins and the task comes back unfinished on today. It runs only
  at start and on rollover, so a past-dated task that arrives later (pulled from a device with the setting off, or put
  back on a past day by an undo or a drag) waits there until the next start or midnight.
- **Setting storage.** Per device in `localStorage` (`plain-week.carry-over`, only `off` is stored; absent means on), in
  `lib/planner/preferences.ts`, followed across tabs through the `storage` event. Plain Week has no synced preferences,
  and this way it works offline and for guests. Settings pages are for registered users, so guests have no switch and
  always get the default (on).

### Drag and drop

Built on `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable` (shadcn has no DnD primitive). Like every other action, a drop only
writes the local database (`moveTask`); sync follows in the background.

| Piece                                               | Role                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PlannerDnd` (`components/planner/planner-dnd.tsx`) | The `DndContext` around the week and Someday: sensors, collision detection, edge zones, drag overlay, announcements, the drop write |
| `TaskList`                                          | A droppable per list (`list:<date>` / `list:someday-<n>`) carrying its `placement` and tasks, and a `SortableContext` of its rows   |
| `TaskRow`                                           | A sortable item carrying its task, `placement` and list; dims while dragged                                                         |
| `lib/planner/drop.ts`                               | Pure functions: drop target → `moveTask` input and the insertion line (`resolveDrop`), edge-zone dates (`edgeDropDate`)             |

- Sensors: mouse after 5 px of movement (so a click still opens the task; the right button never drags), touch with a
  press that holds 250 ms and then moves (a swipe scrolls, a still hold opens the task's context menu instead; see
  [style.md](./style.md#touch-gestures-on-a-task-row)), keyboard from the row's move button (Space or Enter, arrows,
  Space or Enter to drop, Escape to cancel).
  The click that follows a pointer drag (also one cancelled with Escape) is swallowed. Planner shortcuts are
  suspended while a task is dragged.
- Collision detection hit-tests the pointer: edge zones win over task rows, which win over the list they sit in. Over
  a row, the upper half drops above it and the lower half below it; over the rest of a list (its empty rows) the task
  is appended; released anywhere else (gutters, headers) the drag is cancelled. Keyboard drags have no pointer: the
  overlay steps onto a row; within the task's own list it lands below the row when that row is further down than where
  the drag started (so stepping swaps places), in another list above it.
- Days show timed tasks first by time, so only untimed tasks are positional there: the `beforeId`/`afterId` handed to
  `moveTask` are the closest untimed tasks around the drop point, and a timed task keeps its slot by time (moving it
  within its own day is a no-op). Someday columns are positional throughout. A drop that would not change anything
  writes nothing.
- Edge zones (`start` = previous week, `end` = next week, so RTL mirrors) appear only while dragging. Hovering one
  for 600 ms changes the shown week, and keeps doing so while hovered, so the drag continues in the new week. Dropping
  on one moves the task to the same weekday of the week beyond the shown one (a Someday task goes to its Monday),
  appended, and a toast says where it went ("Moved to Wed 21 Oct.") with an Undo that puts it back. The dragged task is
  kept in state, so the drag survives its source row unmounting on a week change.
- A dropped task stays dimmed until its write has committed, so its row does not flash back in its old place.

- Shortcuts only run when focus is not in a text field, no dialog or menu
  (`role="dialog" | "alertdialog" | "menu" | "listbox"`) is open, no task is being dragged (`[data-drag-overlay]`)
  and no Ctrl, Meta or Alt is held. Keys are case-sensitive (`G` is Shift+G). Sequences (`g g`, `d d`) wait 1 s for
  their second key; a key that does not continue a sequence runs on its own. Held keys repeat cursor motions only and
  never complete a sequence. Enter and Space act on the cursor only when focus is on the page, a task's text button
  or a new-task row stop, so other buttons keep them. A shortcut with nothing to act on (Space without a cursor)
  leaves the key's default alone.
- Keys that point left or right are mirrored in RTL: `h` / `←` / `H` go to the next day or week there. `<` / `>` move a
  task to the previous / next day in either direction.
- The cursor is one task, or one list's new-task row (the last stop of each list). Lists are in visual order: Monday to
  Sunday, then the Someday columns (`h` / `l` from Sunday goes on to Someday). It is stored as list, task id and row
  index: it follows its task when the task moves (an occurrence moved becomes an exception with a new id, taken from
  the move's result), and lands on the same row of its list when the task is gone. `h` / `l` go back to the row the
  cursor was last on in the list they enter (remembered per list until the week changes), or else the same row.
  `H` / `L` / `←` / `→` carry it to the same weekday and row; `t` puts it on today. The first motion with no cursor
  starts on today's first task (the first list in another week), or on the focused row when Tab got there first.
- Focus is real and roving: the cursor's task text button, or the new-task row itself (`tabIndex=-1`, not its input,
  so keys there are still shortcuts; Enter, `a` or `i` focus the input and Esc in it comes back), takes focus when the
  cursor moves by key, so screen readers announce it (the new-task row is a group named "New task for Mon 12 Oct.
  Press Enter to type."). Focus inside the row, in a field or in a dialog is never taken. While shown, the cursor
  follows focus (Tab, the task dialog and context menu handing focus back to their task). The task dialog, the context
  menu and the shortcuts dialog return focus to the cursor's row when they close.
- Actions go through the same local writes as the mouse: `toggleDone`, `moveTask` (`J` / `K` use `resolveListDrop`,
  so timed tasks keep their place by time; `<` / `>` change the week when the task leaves it), and the context menu's
  `moveWithUndo` (`w`, `s`), `duplicateWithToast` (`y`) and `deleteWithUndo` (`d d`, asking the scope of a recurring
  task first). `m` opens the context menu anchored to the row's start, like Shift+F10. `a` / `i` with no cursor
  start a task today. Enter opens a task, or starts typing on a new-task row. With no cursor shown and no row
  focused, Enter and `a` act on the row under the mouse, which is what its hint promises; other keys (deletes, moves)
  never act on a row the mouse merely rests on. While the cursor is shown, only its row shows a hint. While a task's
  move or delete is still being written, further moves or deletes of it are ignored, so a quick second press never acts on its old state. `u` presses the newest "Undo" toast still on screen,
  then the one before it (after a toast closes, undoing could overwrite later edits); `<` / `>` / `J` / `K` keep the
  task in view and show no toast, like a drag. `,` opens Settings (signed-in users only; guests have no settings
  page, so the dialog leaves it out).
- The registry has two contexts: the planner keys (`PLANNER_SHORTCUTS`) and the task dialog's ("Task dialog" group,
  `TASK_DIALOG_SHORTCUTS`); a key is unique within its context only (`d` is the date in the dialog, `d d` deletes on
  the planner). The dialog's keys are plain keys, so they run only while focus is in the dialog but not in a text
  field nor in one of its popovers or menus (portaled outside the dialog's element), nor in a part with keys of its own
  (`data-own-keys`: the subtasks, so Delete on a subtask's button never deletes the task), never with Ctrl, Meta or
  Alt, and never on Enter or Space. Delete deletes the task, Backspace does not (easy to press by reflex). A key for a
  disabled picker (`d` on a series row, `r` on a Someday task) does nothing. Combos inside text fields were left out: `Alt+letter` types characters on macOS and opens
  browser menus on Windows, and `Mod+letter` belongs to the browser; Tab leaves a field, and Esc closes the dialog
  from anywhere. There is no `Mod+Enter`: every edit is already saved as it happens. Which toolbar popover is open
  lives in the dialog (`ToolbarPickerContext`, `task-dialog/toolbar-picker.ts`), so `d`, `t`, `r`, `c` and `m` open
  them; one is open at a time.
- Menus (the task context menu, the dialog's More menu) pick an item when its key is pressed while open; the first key
  of a sequence (`d` of `d d`) is held back from the menu's typeahead.

The data layer only helps offline if the app itself loads offline. A service worker (`resources/js/sw.ts`, built by
`vite-plugin-pwa` into `public/sw.js`, scope `/`) keeps the app shell available after the first visit:

| Request                                                                         | Strategy                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Built JS/CSS/fonts/images under `/build/`, the web manifest and `/offline.html` | Precached on install (Workbox precache manifest)                                              |
| Full-page load of `/` (any query: `?week=`, `?task=`)                           | NetworkFirst (3 s timeout); the cached shell on network errors and on `5xx`                   |
| Full-page load of any other page (settings, login, ...)                         | Network only; offline it gets `/offline.html`                                                 |
| `/build/` files missing from this worker's precache                             | Any cache first (a waiting worker's precache), then a CacheFirst cache (200 entries, 30 days) |
| Inertia visits (`X-Inertia` fetches), `/sync/*`, non-GET                        | Not handled: always the network                                                               |

- **The shell.** `/` is cached under one key (`plain-week-shell`), whatever its query string. Only plain `200`
  responses are stored, never redirects. The worker also fetches `/` on install, because the very first visit loads
  `/` before the worker controls the page. When the cached shell is served, the worker points its Inertia page `url` at
  the URL being loaded (`withPageUrl` in `lib/pwa/request-matchers.ts`); otherwise Inertia would rewrite the address
  bar to the `?week=` of whichever visit stored it.
- **Session.** The shell embeds the page props of the visit that stored it (`auth.user`). Login and logout are Inertia
  visits, not full page loads, so the page posts `REFRESH_SHELL` to the worker whenever `auth.user` changes between
  Inertia pages, and the worker re-fetches `/` with the new session. An offline reload after a logout therefore shows
  the guest planner, never the previous user.
- **Inertia asset versioning.** Inertia visits are `fetch` requests (never `navigate`), so the worker never answers
  them and the server's `409` version-mismatch reloads keep working. A shell served offline may carry an older asset
  version; the first visit after reconnecting gets a `409` and Inertia does a full reload, which refreshes the shell.
- **Deploys.** All worker versions share the precache storage until the new one activates, and built files the page
  loads outside the precache are cached at runtime, so the cached shell finds the assets it references. A new worker
  waits; the page shows a Sonner toast ("Update available" with "Reload") that activates it (`SKIP_WAITING`) and
  reloads. Open tabs check for a new worker every hour while online. Other tabs still running the old version behave as
  on any deploy: their next Inertia visit gets a `409` and reloads.
- **Registration** happens in `resources/js/lib/pwa/register.ts`, called from `app.tsx`. Under the Vite dev server it
  instead unregisters any worker left over from testing a production build on the same origin.
- **Offline UX.** Nothing extra is shown while offline: the planner works from IndexedDB and the account button's sync
  status dot covers connectivity. Only server pages need the network. A full-page load of one gets the static
  `/offline.html` page (with a link back to the planner); an in-app Inertia visit to one shows a "You're offline" toast
  (`lib/pwa/offline-visits.ts`). Failed hover prefetches stay silent.

## Server side

Laravel provides:

- Authentication and account settings through Fortify (login, registration, password reset, email verification, 2FA,
  passkeys) with Inertia pages.
- The sync endpoints above.
- The HTML shell and built assets. Planner data is never rendered from server props; pages read it from IndexedDB.
- Optional integrations that work in the background, never on the path of a planner action (see
  [Google Calendar](#google-calendar)).
- Background work: the scheduler (tasks registered in `routes/console.php`) and a worker for the database queue. The
  Docker image runs both next to the server ([self-hosting.md](./self-hosting.md#configuration)), `composer dev` too.
  It never sits between the user and the planner.

### Routes and access

| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /`                                      | `home`                         | Public. Renders the Inertia page `planner` for everyone.¹                            |
| `POST /sync/push`                            | `sync.push`                    | `auth` (session + CSRF). `SyncController@push`.¹                                     |
| `GET /sync/pull`                             | `sync.pull`                    | `auth` (session). `SyncController@pull`.¹                                            |
| `/settings/*`                                |                                | `auth`.                                                                              |
| `GET /settings/data`                         | `data.edit`                    | `auth`. Inertia page `settings/data` (export / import run client-side).              |
| `GET /settings/preferences`                  | `preferences.edit`             | `auth`. Inertia page `settings/preferences` (values stored in the browser).          |
| `GET /settings/integrations`                 | `integrations.edit`            | `auth`.² Inertia page `settings/integrations`.                                       |
| `GET /settings/integrations/google/connect`  | `integrations.google.connect`  | `auth`.¹ ² Redirects to Google's consent screen (`throttle:10,1`).                   |
| `GET /settings/integrations/google/callback` | `integrations.google.callback` | `auth`.¹ ² Google's OAuth redirect URI: stores the connection, creates the calendar. |
| `DELETE /settings/integrations/google`       | `integrations.google.destroy`  | `auth`.² Deletes the calendar, revokes the grant, forgets the connection.            |

¹ Plus `EnsureHasAccess`: in SaaS mode a signed-in account without a paid plan is redirected to the paywall (pages) or
gets `402` (sync). Billing and legal routes are listed in [saas.md](./saas.md).

² Plus `EnsureGoogleCalendarConfigured`: `404` unless `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set. Only
connecting needs a plan in SaaS mode, so an account whose plan lapsed can still see and remove its connection.

After login, registration and email verification Fortify redirects to `/` (`config/fortify.php` → `home`).

**Email verification never blocks the app.** Self-hosted instances often have no mail server, so no route uses the
`verified` middleware. The verify-email flow (notice page, resend link, signed verification URL) still works for
instances that do send mail: the "unverified" notice and resend link live on the profile settings page. Keep
`MAIL_MAILER=log` (the default) when there is no mail server, otherwise sending the verification email fails.

Sync routes always answer in JSON, whatever the `Accept` header: guests get `401 {"message": "Unauthenticated."}`
instead of a redirect, validation errors are `422`, and a missing or stale CSRF token is `419`. Requests must be
same-origin and send the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header from the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. (Laravel 13 also accepts a same-origin
browser request without the token when it carries `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`; send the header anyway so older
browsers work.) Use the Wayfinder helpers
(`@/actions/App/Http/Controllers/SyncController` or `@/routes/sync`) to build the URLs.

The `TrimStrings` and `ConvertEmptyStringsToNull` middleware are skipped for `sync/*`, so strings (empty `notes`,
leading spaces in `text`) round-trip exactly.

`sync_versions`: a single row (`id = 1`) holding the last version handed out, seeded by its migration.

`google_calendar_connections`: at most one per user (see [Google Calendar](#google-calendar)).

| Column                | Type                          | Notes                                                                         |

| `disconnected_reason` | string, nullable              | Set (`invalid_grant`) when Google refuses the tokens: the user must reconnect |

The `Task` model disables Eloquent timestamps (the client owns them). Timestamps go through the
`App\Casts\UtcMillisDateTime` cast: they are stored as UTC with milliseconds and returned in the wire format
`Y-m-d\TH:i:s.v\Z` (`2026-10-15T08:35:00.123Z`), so a pushed value comes back byte for byte.

### Occurrences on the server

Background features (notifications, calendar sync) need what a user's planner shows on some dates, recurring
occurrences included. `App\Tasks\TaskOccurrences::forUser($user, $from, $to)` returns it as a collection of
`App\Tasks\Occurrence` (`id`, `taskId`, `seriesId`, `occurrenceDate`, `date`, `time`, `text`, `notes`, `done`,
`color`, `position`), sorted by date and then in the planner's day order (timed first by time, then position, then id).
It is a port of the client's expansion (`lib/recurrence/expand.ts` and `queryRangeItems`, see
[Recurring tasks (client)](#recurring-tasks-client)) with the same rules and the same test cases
(`tests/Feature/Tasks/TaskOccurrencesTest.php`), so a change to one side goes into both:

- Live plain tasks and exception rows dated in the range; Someday, tombstones and series rows are never returned.
- Every live series anchored on or before the end of the range (and not ended before its start) generates its
  occurrences there: `id` is `${series_id}:${YYYY-MM-DD}`, `taskId` the series, content from the series, not done.
- The winning exception of an occurrence (newest `updated_at`, then greater id) replaces it, wherever it moved, or
  hides it when deleted. A losing duplicate is never returned, and an exception whose series is gone still is.
- Done items are included. An occurrence keeps its `(seriesId, occurrenceDate)` when it is edited or moved (its `id`
  turns from the occurrence id into the exception row's id), so key anything stored per occurrence on that pair.

`$from` and `$to` are taken as calendar dates (`toDateString()`), so convert them to the user's time zone first. It runs
three queries: the dated rows by `(user_id, date)`, the series rows, and their exceptions by `(user_id, series_id)`.

### Google Calendar

A one-way sync from Plain Week to Google Calendar, server side and in the background. It exists only when the
instance has Google OAuth credentials (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `config/services.php`; see
[self-hosting.md](./self-hosting.md#google-calendar)); otherwise its routes are `404` and the settings nav hides it
(shared Inertia prop `integrations.googleCalendar`). Code lives in `app/Integrations/GoogleCalendar`.

- **Connect** (`GoogleOAuth`): authorization code flow with PKCE and a `state` kept in the session. Scopes `openid`,
  `email` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.app.created`, so Plain Week only ever sees calendars it
  created. `access_type=offline` and `prompt=consent` give a refresh token on every connect. The account email comes
  from the ID token. A grant without the calendar scope or the email (Google lets the user untick them) is refused and
  revoked, as is one whose calendar step fails.
- **Calendar** (`ConnectGoogleCalendar`): every connection owns a secondary calendar named "Plain Week", created in
  the user's time zone (`CalendarTimezone`: `users.timezone` when set, else `APP_TIMEZONE`). A reconnect to the same
  Google account keeps the stored calendar when it still exists (`404`/`410`, or a `403` `forbidden`/`notFound`, mean
  gone; other errors such as rate limits fail the connect) and creates a new one otherwise. Connecting another Google
  account disconnects the previous one first. Nothing is stored when a step fails.
- **API calls** (`GoogleCalendarClient`): Laravel's `Http` client against the Calendar REST API. The access token is
  refreshed when it expires within a minute. A refresh that Google answers with `invalid_grant` marks the connection
  broken (`disconnected_reason`, `last_error`) and throws `GoogleCalendarDisconnected`; Settings › Integrations then
  offers "Reconnect". Other failures throw the HTTP client's exceptions and are transient. Event calls go here too.
- **Disconnect** (`DisconnectGoogleCalendar`): deletes the calendar (nothing would keep it current), revokes the
  grant and deletes the row. If the calendar cannot be deleted right now the connection stays and the user gets an
  error to retry; a failed revoke alone does not block it. A broken connection has no working tokens, so it is only
  deleted and the page tells the user to remove the calendar in Google. Deleting the account runs the same cleanup
  first, best effort: the account is deleted whatever Google answers.

### Versioning

A push runs in one database transaction (`App\Actions\Sync\PushTasks`). Its first statement increments the
`sync_versions` counter by the number of records in the batch, reserving a block of versions. Because that write comes
first, the transaction holds the write lock from the start (the row lock on MySQL/PostgreSQL, the database write lock
on SQLite), so concurrent pushes wait for each other and commit their versions in order. A reader therefore never sees
a version appear behind a cursor it has already passed.

Each applied record takes the next version from the block. Records that are skipped (stale or rejected) leave gaps;
versions only need to increase, not be contiguous. Versions are global across users, so a user's versions are not
consecutive either. The SQLite connection sets `busy_timeout` to 5 s (`DB_BUSY_TIMEOUT`) so concurrent writers wait
instead of failing.

### Push semantics

- Records are processed in request order. A record whose `id` belongs to another user goes to `rejected` and is not
  touched.
- A record older than the stored row (`updated_at` strictly lower) is skipped silently: it is in neither `applied` nor
  `rejected`. Equal `updated_at` is applied.
- `cursor` is the highest version among the user's tasks after the push (`0` if the user has none). It is **not** a
  pull position: other devices may have written versions below it that this client has not pulled yet. Only advance
  the stored pull cursor from `/sync/pull` responses.

Validation (`App\Http\Requests\Sync\PushRequest`) rejects the whole batch with `422` if any record is invalid:
`tasks` must be a list of at most 500 records; every field of the contract must be present; `id` a UUID; `date`
`YYYY-MM-DD` or `null`; `someday_column` `0`–`2` and required when `date` is `null`; `color` one of the nine values;
`time` `HH:mm` or `null`; `done` and subtask `done` real booleans; `subtasks` a list of `{ id, text, done }` (subtask
`id` a string of at most 255 characters);
timestamps exactly `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ` (what `Date.prototype.toISOString()` produces); `id` must be lowercase
(the primary key is case sensitive). `text`, `notes` and subtask `text` have no length limit; `position` is at most
255 characters.

A `422` is not transient: retrying the same batch fails again. The client should surface it as an error instead of
retrying forever, and must not drop the other records of the batch. `5xx` and network errors are transient (for
example a SQLite lock that outlives `busy_timeout`) and can be retried.
